    <p>
        The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest
        in recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when
        Smaug came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire,
        Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force.
        Gandalf also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash
        action. The superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned
        to leave on other business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakinsheild</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            <p>
                Fíli and Kíli were brothers, the youngest of the thirteen Dwarves who set out with Thorin Oakenshield's
                company, along with Gandalf and Bilbo Baggins, to reclaim the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

                Fíli and Kíli were the two most active Dwarves of Thorin's company, and, apart from Balin and possibly
                Bombur, they appear more frequently as "individual" characters in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit than the
                rest of Thorin's companions, who are most often named only in group-reference.

            <h3>Óin</h3>
            <p>
                Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
                Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin.

                Óin fought in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined Thorin's
                company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain, wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
                who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
                were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company, as they were the most skilled of the
                group. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
                with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of the company of Thorin.

                Fellowship of the Ring.

                Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of

            <p>
                Balin was a Dwarf leader, the son of Fundin, and elder brother of Dwalin. He was one of the thirteen
                Dwarves who accompanied Thorin II Oakenshield on the quest to regain the Lonely Mountain.
                A Dwarf Lord known for his wise counsel and willingness to listen, he was one of Thorin's closest
                friends and advisers. Balin was distantly related to him, and a descendant of the noble House of Durin.

                He later went to re-establish the Dwarf presence in Moria, but within five years it was overcome once
                more by Orcs, and he was killed there along with the rest of his companions.

            <h3>Dwalin</h3>
            <p>
                Born in TA 2772, two years after the dragon Smaug had desolated Erebor, Dwalin was the son of Fundin and
                younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
                accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

                Later in TA 2841, Dwalin, along with his brother Balin, and a few others accompanied Thráin when he left
                the Ered Luin on a Quest to reclaim Erebor. The small party was dogged by the emissaries of Sauron. In
                TA 2845, Thráin was captured one night when he and his companions sheltered under the eaves of Mirkwood
                from a black rain. After a fruitless search for their king, the Dwarves gave up and returned to Thorin
                to inform him the news.

                the Lonely Mountain from the dragon Smaug.

                Dori was among the Dwarves at Bag End who joined in singing about "blunting the knives" and "bending the
                forks"; as well as accompanying by playing the flute. He was described as “decent fellow despite his
                grumbling”. He often wore a red-violet coat while on the Quest for Erebor. He was noted by Thorin to be
                the strongest of the thirteen companions.[2]

            <p>
                Bilbo Baggins was a Hobbit of the Shire, the main protagonist of The Hobbit and a secondary character in
                The Lord of the Rings.

                Gandalf suggested to Thorin and Company that they hire Bilbo Baggins to be their burglar in the Quest of
                Erebor, and later fought in the Battle of Five Armies. Bilbo was also one of the bearers of the One
                Ring, and the first to voluntarily give it up, although with some difficulty. He wrote many of his
                adventures in a book he called There and Back Again. Bilbo adopted his second-cousin-once-removed Frodo
                Baggins to be his heir after his parents, Drogo Baggins and Primula Brandybuck, drowned in the
                Brandywine River.

                Bilbo was the first hobbit to become famous in the world at large, and one of the few to set foot in the
                Undying Lands.
